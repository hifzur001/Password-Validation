# Password-Validation

The goal of this project is to create a password validation system using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The system will allow users to input a password and then check its strength based on certain criteria. The criteria will include factors such as the length of the password, the use of special characters, and the inclusion of both uppercase and lowercase letters.

To create this system, you will need to use HTML to create the input field and the interface for displaying the strength of the password. You will also need to use CSS to style the interface and make it visually appealing. Finally, you will use JavaScript to write the code that will validate the password and display the strength.

The project aims to create a password validation system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system will allow users to enter a password and validate it based on certain criteria. The validation criteria may include requirements such as minimum length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

The project will be implemented using the following technologies:

HTML: HTML will be used to create the basic structure of the web page. It will include input fields for the password, error messages, and a submit button.

CSS: CSS will be used to style the web page and make it visually appealing. It will be used to format the input fields, error messages, and the overall layout of the page.

JavaScript: JavaScript will be used to implement the password validation logic. It will handle user input, validate the password based on the specified criteria, and display appropriate error messages if the password does not meet the requirements.
